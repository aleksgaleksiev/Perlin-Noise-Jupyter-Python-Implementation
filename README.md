This is a project given as an assignment for an online course. The project is a jupyter notebook which gives an explanation behind the algorithm of generating Perlin noise 
and shows a Python implementation of the algorithm to which generates images and animations of Perlin noise. The above three .gif files were animation created by the Python code.
The example animations from left to right are a Perlin noise animation with 100 frames that looks like clouds, animation of 50 frames of Perlin noise which is similar to a red waving curtain and a three octave Perlin noise animation with 100 frames.
